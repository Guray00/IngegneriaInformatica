    <h1>Guide to Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <p>
        Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British
        mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning
        that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further
        input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial
        configuration and observing how it evolves.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal
        grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live
        or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells
        that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
        time, the following transitions occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by
            underpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
            generation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
            overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as
            if by reproduction.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        To start playing the Game of Life, you need to set up an initial
        configuration of live and dead cells. This can be done manually or by using
        a random configuration. Once the initial state is set, the game progresses
        in steps, with each step applying the rules to every cell simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h2>Patterns</h2>
    <p>
        Over time, certain patterns may emerge in the Game of Life. Some of the most
        well-known patterns include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Still lifes:</strong> These are patterns that do not change from
            one generation to the next. Examples include the block, the beehive, and
            the loaf.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Oscillators:</strong> These are patterns that return to their
            initial state after a fixed number of generations. Examples include the
            blinker, the toad, and the beacon.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Spaceships:</strong> These are patterns that translate
            themselves across the grid. The most famous example is the glider.
